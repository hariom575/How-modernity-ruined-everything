So in the begining for us humans during the ice age was Animism. The idea of Animism is that we Human being are no diffrent than other conscious being.
in the world. We are like tree's, we are like animals and interconnected together.
And life is just a cycle of life and death, birth and rebirth and this religion is still alive today in many primitive societies for e.g. in Amazon. Then we tranisitioned to the Mother goddess. So as we became more Agriculture, fertility was more and more important, you need to have more and more children and we needed to grow more crops. So we began to worship **Mother godess** and women were of very high status at this stage of history But as population grew and towns came into being, They came into competition with each other they started war with each other, and this crated **Polythiesm**. Polythiesm is the idea that each place has it's own God . That it's patron. And when this places come into conflicts and war, the way they settled disputes is loosing party, their god became **Servent** of winning party. And this create the idea of **Pantheon** that we see in **Greek, Roman Methology as well as  Norse Methology.**
Now the radical break from this tradition was the birth of **Monothiesm** . There is going to be some scholarly debate which is first monothiestic relegion, some says there are certain Egyptian cults that is monothiestic. Some says the jews were and some says the the Zoroastrians were. In this class what you learn is it the  **Christians** who were the first **Monothiestic Religion** . And the reason why is the cristians Introduced the idea of **Holy Trinity**. Holy Trinity the idea is God, Jesus and The Holy spirit these are diffrent entities, but they are co-equal to each others they are saparate but unified, they are different but equal.
And this idea it's very hard to logically reconsile. The only way for us to understand is if **GOD** is both **Nothing and Everything** at the same time. Therefore it excludes everything and this is the idea of monothiesm and the power of monothiesm is that for the first time of human history, and for the first it created the idea of Individual. When God is everything you have direct connection with God, and it removes you from the community. Now this will create lot of problems in the future. But it this point in the history remember monothiesm is promoted by Roman Empire as way to consolidate its rule over its vast territory. At this stage in the history this is not a problem . And the reason why is mediating you and god is the catholic church.
But not only that the catholic church mediates God for everyone. So in this way the church creates it's own community. So at this stage in history this is not a problem. But rememeber the church became corrupt and there were many religious reformer believed that you dont really need church to access God. In fact, you are the more imperative to access god directily through Bible. You have to read bible by your self, you have to interprete it properly. so obviously martin Luther was one of the greatest reformer.
Now this is imporant because what will happen is by limiting the church you create direct access to god and this creates the Idea of **Crisis in Faith**.
The Idea of crisis in faith is how do you truely know as person, wether or not you truely loves god or not? and How do you know God loves you? Think about your Mother, You know your mother loves you and you love your mother but there are many days when you really hate your mother and you fight with your mother. So it's hard for us to to not doubt ourself, and so it creates crisis in Faith becuase in Protestantinism you are required to show absolute faith and devotion in god. If you doubt, if you hasitate, you will be condemned to hell. So this creates the idea of crisis in faith. 
Historically there have been many solutions to this problem. Different prophets have proposed different solutions. So let's look at three different solutions. All right, so the first solution is the Idea of **Wealth Accumulation** . So this are the Calvanists right? they argue that to show your true faith in god you have to prove to your self that god truely loves you, you make a lot of money. That is the testements of your faith, wealth Accumulation. So that's one solution. it's what gives as capitalism today.
The second solution is the Idea of **JIHAD** .
You will die for your faith. You will sacrifice your self to promote the truth of god Thats also the solution.
