So in the begining for us humans during the ice age was Animism. The idea of Animism is that we Human being are no diffrent than other conscious being.
in the world. We are like tree's, we are like animals and interconnected together.
And life is just a cycle of life and death, birth and rebirth and this religion is still alive today in many primitive societies for e.g. in Amazon. Then we tranisitioned to the Mother goddess. So as we became more Agriculture, fertility was more and more important, you need to have more and more children and we needed to grow more crops. So we began to worship **Mother godess** and women were of very high status at this stage of history But as population grew and towns came into being, They came into competition with each other they started war with each other, and this crated **Polythiesm**. Polythiesm is the idea that each place has it's own God . That it's patron. And when this places come into conflicts and war, the way they settled disputes is loosing party, their god became **Servent** of winning party. And this create the idea of **Pantheon** that we see in **Greek, Roman Methology as well as  Norse Methology.**
Now the radical break from this tradition was the birth of **Monothiesm** . There is going to be some scholarly debate which is first monothiestic relegion, some says there are certain Egyptian cults that is monothiestic. Some says the jews were and some says the the Zoroastrians were. In this class what you learn is it the  **Christians** who were the first **Monothiestic Religion** . And the reason why is the cristians Introduced the idea of **Holy Trinity**. Holy Trinity the idea is God, Jesus and The Holy spirit these are diffrent entities, but they are co-equal to each others they are saparate but unified, they are different but equal.
And this idea it's very hard to logically reconsile. The only way for us to understand is if **GOD** is both **Nothing and Everything** at the same time.
